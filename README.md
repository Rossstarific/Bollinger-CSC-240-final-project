# Bollinger-CSC-240-final-project
Organization of Computer Systems Final Project Repository
The goal of this project was to write a program in assembly that would project a small game on a 64x128 LED screen provided in class.
This was accomplished using said screen, an ATTiny416 microcontroller, four buttons, and Atmel Studio.
The game is simple: pilot a spaceship around the screen, and if you touch any of the edges before the game ends, you lose.
If you are able to stay on the screen long enough, then you win. The main code files will explain how this is done in the comments.
